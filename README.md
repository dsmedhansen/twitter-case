# twitter-case

This is the github repo for our first case study.

The overall goal of this assignment will be to show differences in a selected group of battleground states and districts within those states

- To do:
  - Combine data into new dataframe (Martijn)
    - The following variables will be included
      - Index of tweet
      - Sentiment of tweet with Vader (Martijn)
      - Tweet handles in tweet (Trump or Hillary) (Martijn)
      - Country of the tweeter (Martijn)
       - State of tweeter (from Slavo)
        - County of tweeter (From Slavo)
        - Proportion black per county (From Anson)
        - Proportion white per county (From Anson)
        - Proportion lation per county (From Anson)
        - Educatinal level (proportion of people in county that have a bachelor or above) (From Anson)
        - Mean income level per county (From Anson)
        - Vote proportion for Republican (From Daniel)
        - Vote proportion for Democrat (From Daniel)
        - Gini-coefficient per county (From Daniel)
        - Mean sentiment Hillary per country, state, and county (Martijn)
        - Mean sentiment Trump per country, state, and county (Martijn)
        
  - Get report writing up-and-runnning (Daniel)
  - Build model to predict results of elections (regression)
  - Run topic model for two battleground states and compare output

For the ones new to Github (like me) this short video was pretty helpful in explaining how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
