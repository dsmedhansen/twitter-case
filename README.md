# twitter-case

This is the github repo for our first case study.

The overall goal of this assignment will be to show differences in a selected group of battleground states and districts within those states

- To do:
  - Do basic visualization of data (see notebook intro)
  - Map locations to country and districts in the US (Slavo)
  - Calculate sentiment with SentiStrenght (Martijn)
  - Add country-variable to dataset
  - Calculate sentiment per country (output: map)
     - Show sentiment per state (output should be a map)
     - Show sentiment per district in battleground states (outout: map)
  - Get demographic info and add to dataframe:
    - Race (if possible)
    - Age
    - Educational level
  - 

For the ones new to Github (like me) this short video was pretty helpful in explaining how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE

Own ideas:
- After the elections Twitter has removed around 10.000 trolling accounts, maybe if we can find the dataset with the troll-accounts it would be nice to filter them out and compare results in terms of sentiment and retweets..
- Correlate sentiment with electoral results
- Topic modelling and break down per state or over time
  - Time-series model of topics over time in a subset of states
- Maybe read this paper for inspiration: "Bots and Automation over Twitter during the First U.S. Presidential Debate"

RQ's to think about (mail from Andrew): 

  1. Were you able to load and parse the twitter data into a useful format for comparison with other data (e.g. state locations, demographics)? Were you able to show that you could do this clearly/visually? 
  2. Are you able to get insights into the data before using sentiment or topic analysis? If yes, what could you show? If not, why not?  
  3. Did sentiment analyses help identify supporters of each candidate? How did sentiment correlate with other information like demographics? That is to say - where is each candidate popular, and who are they popular with?  Were you able to show this information clearly/visually? If you could not use sentiment analysis, why not?  
  4. Were you able to combine sentiment knowledge with a topic analysis?  That is, were you able to show what supporters who were positive/negative towards each candidate talked about? Could you show this clearly/visually? If you could not use topic analysis, why not? 
  5. Could you relate your results to the actual state-voting patterns in the election? What are you able to show, and how confident are you in your findings?
