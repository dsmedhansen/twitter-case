This is the github repo for our first case study.

  - Combine data into new dataframe (Martijn)
    - The following variables will be included
      - Index of tweet
      - Sentiment of tweet with Vader
       - State of tweeter
        - County of tweeter
        - Proportion black per county
        - Proportion white per county
        - Proportion lation per county
        - Educatinal level (proportion of people in county that have a bachelor or above)
        - Mean income level per county
        - Median age per county 
 
  - Get report writing up-and-runnning (Daniel)
  - Build two maps with mean sentiment: One with Trump's twitter handle as keyword and one with Hillary's twitterhandle as keyword
