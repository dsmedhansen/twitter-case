Last sprint to-do's:
  - Correlation between trump vote and trump sentiment at the county level
  - build and illustrate topic model
  - Build model to predict results of elections (regression)
  - Run topic model for two selected states: preferably one with the highest Trump-vote and one with highest Hillary-vote

For the ones new to Github (like me) this short video was pretty helpful in explaining how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE

Lessons learnt:
  - Reduce date before doing calculations
  - Make sure you know the ins and outs of your sentiment library (vader takes capitals into account and we used w.lower() and removed special characters)
